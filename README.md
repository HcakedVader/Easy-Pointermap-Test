# Easy Pointermap Test

How to use it : 

Hit enter when you start the program.

After you hit enter once, you can hit any key to display the next number.

This was INTENTIONALLY designed for people who are just starting out.
Also yeah, I get it, don't use "using namespace std;". In my defense tho, I am lazy
and just forgot to remove it. :P
